# Event Type System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

The calendar event system has been successfully refactored to use **event types** instead of storing raw hex color codes. The system now supports 5 predefined event types, each with its own color scheme.

## 📋 Event Types

| Event Type | Label | Color | Use Case |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|
| `senate_meeting` | Senate Meeting | 🟣 Purple (#9D45FC) | Regular senate meetings and sessions |
| `committee_meeting` | Committee Meeting | 🟢 Green (#34C237) | Committee meetings and subcommittee sessions |
| `office_hours` | Office Hours | 🟡 Yellow (#FFBF00) | Student government office hours |
| `administrative_meeting` | Administrative Meeting | 🔴 Red (#FF3A3A) | Administrative and planning meetings |
| `misc` | Misc. | 🔵 Blue (#2E82E8) | Other events and miscellaneous activities |

   - Includes locations

### Documentation
5. **`CALENDAR_SETUP.md`**
   - Updated API documentation
   - Event type usage examples
   - Color scheme reference

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. For New Installations

Simply run the setup as normal. The schema already includes event types:

```bash
# Seed sample events with event types
node src/app/db-test-script/seed-events.js
```

### 2. For Existing Databases

Run the migration script:

```sql
-- Execute the migration
-- File: db_schema/migration-add-event-type.sql
```

This will:
- Add the `event_type` column
- Map existing events based on their colors
- Set unmapped events to 'misc'

### 3. Creating Events Through UI

1. Navigate to `/calendar`
2. Click the "Add Event" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - Title (required)
   - Event Type (required) - Select from dropdown
   - Description (optional)
   - Location (optional)
   - Start Date (required)
   - End Date (optional)
   - Toggle "All-day event" if needed
4. Click "Add Event"

### 4. Creating Events Programmatically

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/add-event", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: "Senate Meeting - Fall Session",
    description: "Monthly senate meeting",
    start_time: "2025-10-15T14:00:00",
    end_time: "2025-10-15T16:00:00",
    location: "Student Center Room 201",
    event_type: "senate_meeting", // ← Required
    is_all_day: false,
  }),
});
```

## 🎨 Customizing Colors

To change colors for an event type, edit `src/lib/eventTypes.ts`:

```typescript
export const EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG: Record<EventType, EventTypeConfig> = {
  senate_meeting: {
    label: "Senate Meeting",
    backgroundColor: "#C4B5FD", // ← Change here
    borderColor: "#8B5CF6",
    textColor: "#5B21B6",
  },
  // ... other types
};
```

All events of that type will automatically update!

## 🔄 Adding New Event Types

1. Update `src/lib/eventTypes.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export type EventType = 
     | "senate_meeting"
     | "committee_meeting" 
     | "office_hours"
     | "administrative_meeting"
     | "misc"
     | "your_new_type"; // ← Add here
   ```

2. Add configuration:
   ```typescript
   your_new_type: {
     label: "Your New Type",
     backgroundColor: "#HEXCODE",
     borderColor: "#HEXCODE",
     textColor: "#HEXCODE",
   },
   ```

3. Update database schema CHECK constraint

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
2. **Centralized Colors** - Change once, apply everywhere
3. **Easy Categorization** - Events grouped by type
4. **Future-Proof** - Easy to extend with more properties
5. **User-Friendly UI** - Complete modal with all fields
6. **Validation** - API validates event types
7. **Clean Schema** - No redundant color column

## 🧪 Testing

Test the implementation:

```bash
# 1. Seed sample events
node src/app/db-test-script/seed-events.js

# 2. Visit the calendar
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/calendar

# 3. Try adding an event
# Click "Add Event" and fill the form

# 4. Verify colors
# Each event type should have its designated color
```

## 📊 Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All events of same type look the same
2. **Maintainability** - Update colors in one place
3. **Scalability** - Easy to add new types and properties
4. **Better UX** - Users can filter/search by type (future feature)
5. **Data Integrity** - Type validation at API and DB level

## 🔍 What's Next?

Potential future enhancements:
- Event type filtering in calendar view
- Color legend/key showing all event types
- Recurring events support
- Event editing and deletion modals
- Export events by type
- Event type analytics/reports

## 📝 Notes

- Colors are automatically determined by `event_type`
- All event types are defined in `src/lib/eventTypes.ts`
- To add new event types, update the EventType union and EVENT_TYPE_CONFIG
- The database CHECK constraint ensures only valid event types are stored

## 🤝 Need Help?

- See `CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for API documentation
- Review `src/lib/eventTypes.ts` for event type configuration
