# Senate-sync

## Overview

The **Attorney Appointment Scheduler and Senate Voting System** combines two essential functionalities:

1. **Attorney Appointment Scheduler:** Streamlines the scheduling of legal consultations, allowing clients to book and manage attorney appointments efficiently.  
2. **Senate Voting System:** Provides a secure and transparent platform for student government members to cast votes on motions and proposals.

This project is built with **Next.js** to deliver a modern, server-rendered, and highly performant web application.
