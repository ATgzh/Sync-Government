This folder previously contained placeholder images created by the assistant. They were intentionally temporary and have been removed. Keep exported images from Figma or other sources here and name them `msu-logo.png`, `hero.jpg`, `team1.jpg`, etc. Restart dev server after adding new files.

To add real images:
1. Export images from Figma as PNG/JPG
2. Place them into `public/images/`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
